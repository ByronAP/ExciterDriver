## Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check the existing [issues](https://github.com/ByronAP/ExciterDriver/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.

If you can't find an open issue addressing the problem, please [open a new one](https://github.com/ByronAP/ExciterDriver/issues/new). Be sure to include as much detail as possible in your report:

- **A clear and descriptive title.**
- **A detailed description of the bug.** What did you expect to happen, and what actually happened?
- **Steps to reproduce the behavior.** Provide a clear, step-by-step sequence of actions.
- **Hardware setup.** Describe the specific components you are using (Arduino model, MOSFET, etc.).
- **Software versions.** Include the version of the regulator software and the Arduino IDE you are using.
- **Screenshots or Serial Monitor logs.** If applicable, add screenshots or copy-paste relevant logs to help explain the problem.

## Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features and improvements. To suggest an enhancement:

1. **Check for existing suggestions.** Search the [issues](https://github.com/ByronAP/ExciterDriver/issues) to see if your idea has already been proposed.
2. **Open a new issue.** If your idea is new, create a new issue.
3. **Provide details.** Clearly describe your proposed enhancement, explaining why it would be useful and how you envision it working.

## Your First Code Contribution

Ready to contribute code? Hereâ€™s how to set up your environment and submit your changes.

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Fork the repository.** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork.** Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ExciterDriver.git
   ```
3. **Create a new branch.** It's important to create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your work separate from the main branch and makes it easier to manage.
   ```sh
   git checkout -b your-descriptive-branch-name
   ```
   For example: `git checkout -b fix-pid-overshoot` or `git checkout -b feature-temperature-comp`.

### Making Changes

1. **Write your code.** Make your changes to the source code, following the existing code style outlined in the **Style Guide** below.
2. **Add comments.** If you add a new feature or complex logic, be sure to add comments to explain what your code does.
3. **Test your changes.** Ensure that your changes work as expected and do not introduce any new bugs.
4. **Commit your changes.** Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add temperature compensation feature"
   ```
   We encourage using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages (e.g., `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`).

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch.** Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:
   ```sh
   git push origin your-descriptive-branch-name
   ```
2. **Open a Pull Request (PR).** Go to your fork on GitHub and click the "Compare & pull request" button.
3. **Provide a clear description.** Fill out the pull request template with a clear title and a detailed description of your changes. Explain the "why" behind your changes and link to any relevant issues.
4. **Wait for review.** Your PR will be reviewed by the project maintainers. We may ask for changes or clarification. We'll do our best to provide timely feedback.

## Style Guide

To maintain consistency throughout the codebase, please adhere to the following style guidelines when contributing code.

### Formatting

- **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces for indentation, not tabs.
- **Braces:** Opening braces `{` go on the same line as the statement (`if`, `for`, `while`, function definitions).
  ```cpp
  // Good
  if (condition) {
    // ...
  }

  // Bad
  if (condition)
  {
    // ...
  }
  ```
- **Spacing:** Use a single space around operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, etc.) and after commas.
  ```cpp
  // Good
  int value = someValue * 2;
  myFunction(arg1, arg2);

  // Bad
  int value=someValue*2;
  myFunction(arg1,arg2);
  ```
- **Line Length:** While not a strict rule, try to keep lines under 100 characters for better readability.

### Naming Conventions

- **Variables:** Use `camelCase` for local and global variables (e.g., `averageVoltage`, `lastError`).
- **Constants:** Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants defined with `const` or `#define` (e.g., `TARGET_VOLTAGE`, `MAX_PULSE_INTERVAL_MICROS`).
- **Functions:** Use `camelCase` for functions (e.g., `readVoltage`, `updateEngineState`).
- **Enums & Structs:** Use `PascalCase` for `enum` and `struct` type definitions (e.g., `EngineState`, `FaultLog`). Enum members should be `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `FAULT_OVER_VOLTAGE`).
- **Pin Definitions:** Name pin constants descriptively using `camelCase` with a `Pin` suffix (e.g., `vSensePin`, `fieldControlPin`).

### Comments

- **File Header:** New `.ino` or `.h`/`.cpp` files should include a header comment explaining the purpose of the file.
- **Function Headers:** Use block comments (`/** ... */`) before complex function definitions to explain what the function does, its parameters, and what it returns.
  ```cpp
  /**
   * Blinks the error LED a specific number of times to indicate a code.
   * @param code The number of times to blink.
   */
  void blinkCode(int code) {
    // ...
  }
  ```
- **Inline Comments:** Use `//` for single-line comments to explain non-obvious or complex lines of code. Explain the *why*, not the *what*.
  ```cpp
  // Good: Explains the purpose
  // Reset the timer because the condition has cleared.
  lowVoltageTimerStart = 0;

  // Bad: Just restates the code
  // Set lowVoltageTimerStart to 0.
  lowVoltageTimerStart = 0;
  ```
